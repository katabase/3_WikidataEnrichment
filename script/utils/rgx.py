    pattern
    -------
    the patterns in the example below are simplified to keep things readable
    - two strings separated by a "-" or "\s"
    - the first or second string can be a full name ([A-Z][a-z]+)
      or an abbreviation ([A-Z][a-z]*\.)
    - if the strings are separated by "\s", they must be finished by "\."
      (to be sure that we don't capture full names, i.e: "J. Ch."  can be captured,
      but not "Jean Charles")
    - complex names with 3 or more words must have "-" and at least one "\."
    - (\s|$) and (^|\s) are safeguards to avoid matching the end or beginning of another word
